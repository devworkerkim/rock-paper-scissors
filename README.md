#Rock Paper Scissors
##The Odin Project

This is my repo for the Rock Paper Scissors project from The Odin Project.

## Foundations course
In the Foundations course, the Rock Paper Scissors project had us create the basic game logic using three functions.  The first function is a randomly generated play for the computer.  The second function is the game itself that returns a string with the result based on the player's and computer's selections.  The third function plays five games.

The game is played on the browser's console, but future projects will move this play onto the page.
